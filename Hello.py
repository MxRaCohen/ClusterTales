    ClusterTales is an open-source clustering app built specifically for recommending
    TV shows and movies based on their [Tropes](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Trope).
    **ðŸ‘ˆ Get started with the ðŸŽ­ Content Recommender from the sidebar** to see an example
    of what ClusterTales can do!
    ### Want to learn more?
    - After selecting a starting point in the ðŸŽ­ **Content Recommender**, check out the ðŸ”Ž **Trope Explorer** to learn more about Tropes.
    - Jump into our ðŸ“— **Documentation** to learn more about how ClusterTales works.
    ### Having trouble?
    - ClusterTales works with a large dataset and will likely take upwards of 3 minutes to initialize. Patience is paramount!
    - The images on ClusterTales may be clickable but I do not recommend it as it will reload the entire page again.
    - Tried 'loving' a trope but it didn't work? Try 'loving' a different trope and the first is sure to pop-up!
